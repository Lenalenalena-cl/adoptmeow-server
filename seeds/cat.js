I do play with toys with you and alone but not for long. Once I settle in with you I will try to take your spot on the couch or at worst lean on you while sitting next to you.",

In one of the tests I did, it showed that I am FIV positive, which is a disease that makes me a little more delicate, but it doesn't stop me from living well and happy!
